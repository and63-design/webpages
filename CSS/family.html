  <p>The <span class="serif">City of New York</span>
    was introduced to professional football on the same day
    that the city was introduced to the 
    <span class="fantasy">New York Giants.</span>
    It was a clear sunny
    <span class="mono">October afternoon in 1925</span>
    when the Giants took the field to play against the 
    <span class="cursive">Frankland Yellow Jackets</span>
